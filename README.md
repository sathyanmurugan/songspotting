# SongSpotting

Mad shouts to Cam Linke and the folks at Real Python for this awesome blog post: https://realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup

### Setup
1. Download this repository

2. Navigate to the root directory of the project
```cd songspotting```

3. Create a Virtual Environment and activate it
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the required libraries
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

5. Establish Local Settings
To set up our application with environment variables, weâ€™re going to use autoenv. This program allows us to set commands that will run every time we cd into our directory. In order to use it, we will need to install it globally. First, exit out of your virtual environment in the terminal, install autoenv, then and add a .env file:

```
deactivate
pip install autoenv
touch .env
```

Next, in your .env file, add the following:
```
source venv/bin/activate
export DEBUG=True
export APP_SECRET_KEY='Insert Flask App Secret Key'
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID='Insert Spotify Client Id'
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET='Insert Spotify Client Secret'
```

Now run the following to update then refresh your .bashrc:
```
echo "source `which activate.sh`" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, if you move up a directory and then cd back into it, the virtual environment will automatically be started and the environment variables are declared.


### Running the app
Run the following command to start the app
```python app.py```


### Things to remember 
If you install a new library, remember to add it to the requirements file. For example:
```
pip install gunicorn
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
